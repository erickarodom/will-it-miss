# Will It Miss: MDN Web Docs Frontend Toolchain Project
This is the finished project from the MDN Web Docs article "[Understanding client-side web development tools](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/Tools_and_testing/Understanding_client-side_tools)".
>"Client-side tooling can be intimidating, but this series of articles aims to illustrate the purpose of some of the most common client-side tool types, explain the tools you can chain together,
how to install them using package managers, and control them using the command line. We finish up by providing a complete toolchain example showing you how to get productive."

## Thoughts
This project was exactly what I needed at the time.  I had been working a lot with WordPress and Elementor.  I had gotten a bit rusty and needed a quick sensible walkthrough.
I was familiar with all the topics, since they were things I had gone over in bootcamp, but needed something I could do in an afternoon that would bring it all back.

If that describes you I recommend this quick little project.  It is simple yet thorough and not very time consuming.
At the end of it, the rust was off, I learned some new things, got clarity on others, and had a quick littly project to show for it.
